# ScratchX is no longer supported 
#### ScratchX is now archived and no longer supported because Adobe Flash has reached end of life. If you're interested in developing extensions for Scratch, please visit the [Scratch-GUI](https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-gui) repo as a starting point for building a local version of the Scratch editor. It can be linked to your local version of [Scratch-VM](https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-vm), where you can create your own extensions.
